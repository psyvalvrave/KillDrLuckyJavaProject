# CS5010-DrLuckyGame
This is a class project to kill a game base with java. It is similar to the board game Kill Doctor Lucky, but it has some different rules. 

## Milestone 1: Game Board Creation

In this initial milestone, the focus was on laying the foundation of the game environment. We successfully implemented the creation of the game board using the `World` class, and defined the `Room` and `Target` entities within the game.

### Key Features
- **World Class:** Constructs the game board and initializes the rooms based on predefined configurations.
- **Room and Target Setup:** Rooms are strategically placed within the world, and a target is assigned to one of these rooms.

### How to View the Output
First able, you have to move KillDoctorLucky.jar in the res folder in to the root directory of this project, which is the same directory as src, test, res folder.
Then, to see the game board and the target's location, run the provided JAR file with the following command:

```bash
java -jar KillDoctorLucky.jar.jar
```

There will be a txt file to show the example run to show some text info about how a test run is. The code you are running is in the src/WorldDriver.java
